Repository for various scripts and files used to analyse the official [Fantasy Premier League](http://fantasy.premierleague.com/).

Details of the API I use to grab the data are listed on [Bill Mill's site](http://billmill.org/fantasypl/).

I've written several posts about my use of this data on my [personal site](http://www.clwatkins.co/post/)
